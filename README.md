Unearthed from the archives of the Before Times.

Do not run this; it will probably destroy the universe.

Attempting to compile may or may not bring about the extinction of the human race, but if you want to give it a try, you'll need [Allegro 4.0](https://liballeg.org/old.html). Other 4.x versions may work.

The original DOS version and the editor seem to be lost to time. This is the first of two Windows versions; the second and later version replaced Allegro with SDL, but it also seems to have been eaten by Langoliers.

Copyright infringement ahoy in the music and sfx directories! Please don't sue, I was a dumb kid and I promise I learned how pointers work eventually.
